- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Yigitceli, well my friends call me as YiÄŸit. I am currently studying Translation and Interpreting at Bilkent University but also taking online
courses to learn full-stack web development. I took my first step to become a developer 1 years ago and now i can call my self a full-stack web developer.

**************************

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Video Games, Basketball, Movies, Technology, Web Development and also Video Game Development but i don't know much about Vide Game Development for now. I have been involved with computers since I was little. I could solve all of the computer
problems which i encountered as i was even child with some google research. 

**************************

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PERN stack which means PostgreSQL, REACT.js, EXPRESS.js, NODE.js. Actually i have already learned this stack but like every develoepr i have to pratice
more and more to become better. Also, i'm studying at Bilkent University in Translation and Interpreting which is good because i learned French apart from English, so that means 
i can speak English enough and enough but not as good as English, some French and i can also speak my Native language Turkish.
